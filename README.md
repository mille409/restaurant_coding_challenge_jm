### 'DEPLOYMENT EXPLANATION AND WALKTHROUGH: JACOB MILLER'

*This is Jacob Miller here with an explanation on how to build and produce the code I've written for this coding challenge.
I was not sure how you wanted me to deploy this app precisely so I elected to use GitHub pages.
If you would like to simply view the latest version of the app in production just navigate to the following URL in your preferred browser: 
https://mille409.github.io/restaurant_coding_challenge_jm 
To deploy this app to gitHub pages navigate to the project root and run the following command "npm run deploy".
Make sure that you are on the main branch when you do this. 
After the terminal states that the deployment was successful, open a browser (I would recommend Chrome) and enter the following URL into the navbar: 
https://mille409.github.io/restaurant_coding_challenge_jm
This URL can also be found under the homepage key in the package.json file. This should allow you to view the production version of the app. 
I hope you enjoy the code. 

### 'NOTES ON THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE'
In the spirit of the coding challenge there are no third party components whatsoever in the entirety of the code. The magnifying glass icon used for the 
search bar is from 'font awesome' which is a common practice and does not constitute a component.
